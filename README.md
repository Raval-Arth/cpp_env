Auto Run CPP 🚀
===============

Welcome to the **Auto Run CPP** project! Here, we dive into the exciting world of automated C++ execution. This tool aims to enhance your programming experience and efficiency. Let’s explore why this is important! 🌟


Getting Started 🚦
------------------

To set up **Auto Run CPP** in your own projects, simply follow these steps:

### Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python** (version 3.6 or later)
    
*   **C++ Compiler** (g++)
    
*   **Git** (to clone the repository)
    
### Step 1: Clone the Repository 🛠️

Open your terminal (or command prompt) and clone the repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Raval-Arth/cpp_env.git   `
```

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory 📂

Change to the directory of the cloned repository:
```
cd cpp_env   `
```

### Step 3: Install watchdog Python Package 📦

Run the following command to ensure you have watchdog installed:
```
pip install watchdog   `
```

### Step 4: Prepare Your C++ Files 📝

Place your C++ source files (e.g., main.cpp) in the project directory. Ensure that your code is ready for compilation.

### Step 5: Run the Python Script 🐍

To automatically compile and run your C++ program, execute the following command:
```
python auto_run_cpp.py   `
```

This script will:

1.  **Compile** your C++ files using the specified compiler.
    
2.  **Run** the compiled executable, displaying the output directly in your terminal.

What is Auto Run CPP? 🤔
------------------------

**Auto Run CPP** is a clever setup designed to automatically compile and run your C++ programs with minimal manual intervention. No more tedious command-line typing—just write your code and let the magic happen! ✨

Why Auto Run CPP? 🧐
--------------------

1.  **Boost Productivity** ⏱️Automating the run process allows developers to focus on what truly matters: writing great code! By reducing the time spent on repetitive tasks, you can devote more energy to creativity and problem-solving.
    
2.  **Immediate Feedback** 🔄Quickly see the results of your changes! The auto-run feature provides instant feedback, helping you identify issues early in the development cycle. Catch bugs before they become headaches! 🐛
    
3.  **Encourages Experimentation** 🎨With reduced barriers to running code, you’re more likely to experiment and innovate. Try new algorithms, tweak parameters, and explore concepts without fear of tedious setups.
    
4.  **Learning Enhancement** 📚For beginners, the auto-run feature simplifies the learning curve. As you focus on understanding programming concepts, the hassle of manual execution fades away, allowing you to concentrate on mastering C++.
    
5.  **Streamlined Workflow** 🔗Integrating auto-run into your workflow can lead to a smoother coding experience. Combine it with version control systems like Git, and you’ll have a powerful toolkit at your fingertips! 🛠️   

### Important Notes ⚠️
    
*   If you encounter any errors during compilation, review your C++ code for any syntax or logical issues.    
*   You can modify the auto\_run\_cpp.py script to customize the compilation process or add additional features as needed.
